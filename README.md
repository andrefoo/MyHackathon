# TikTok Product Swiping Discovery Feature

## Overview
This repository contains our prototype that aims to personalize user shopping experiences through an innovative "For You Page" card. By integrating **swipeable shopping cards** akin to Tinder's interface, we aim to collect user preferences and **utilize machine learning to tailor product recommendations dynamically**.

## Features
- **Swipeable Shopping Cards**: Implement swipeable card interfaces within the TikTok feed. These cards will appear intermittently between standard content cards (videos), and are linked to the product detail in TikTok Shop directly.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: The content of each card is generated based on the userâ€™s previous interactions and preferences, providing a unique and personalized shopping experience.
- **Image Recognition Algorithm**: Our image recognition algorithm can identify spotlight items in user videos (e.g., a red handbag). Based on the spotlight items detected, the shopping card will recommend similar items available on TikTok Shop.


## Technology Stack
- React.js

## Summary
The proposed enhancements to TikTok Shop are designed to transform the shopping experience by integrating personalized, actionable shopping opportunities directly into the user's social feed. This approach is expected to increase engagement and conversion rates by leveraging sophisticated machine learning techniques to cater to individual preferences.
